# about

Complex Forming is structured to enhance students' technical skills in creating, analysing, and manipulating complex geometries through parametric design. Students will explore mathematical surfaces, tensile structures, voxel aggregation, recursion, particle-based systems, and tessellation techniques as they apply to architectural form-finding and design. Through Grasshopper3D and Python, students will engage with algorithmic thinking and computational methods to produce sophisticated, data-driven forms that can be applied throughout their time in MaCAD.
